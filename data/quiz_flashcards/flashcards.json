    "topic": "Scope",
    "question": "What is the difference between global and local scope in Python?",
    "answer": "A variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope of that function, and can only be used inside that function. A variable created in the main body of the Python code is a global variable and belongs to the global scope. Global variables are available from within any scope, global and local."

    "topic": "Iteration",
    "question": "What is an iterator in Python?",
    "answer": "An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values and can be iterated upon. In Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, consisting of the methods __iter__() and __next__()."

    "id": 17,
    "topic": "Data Types",
    "question": "Can you copy a List in Python by simply writing: list2 = list1?",
    "answer": "No, because list2 will only be a reference to list1. Changes made in list1 will also affect list2. To make a copy of a list, use copy() or the list() method."
